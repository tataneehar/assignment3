# Assignment 3 – Functions & Modules in Python

This repository contains Python programs developed for **Assignment 3 (Module 4)**.  
The assignment focuses on understanding **functions**, **recursion**, and the use of **built-in modules** in Python.

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Description
This program calculates the **factorial of a number** using a user-defined function and recursion.

### Functionality
- Defines a function named `factorial(n)` that:
  - Takes a number as an argument.
  - Uses **recursion** to calculate the factorial.
- Returns the calculated factorial value.
- Takes user input and prints the factorial of the entered number.

### Sample Output
Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120

### Concepts Used
- Functions
- Recursion
- User input and output

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### Description
This program uses Python’s built-in **math module** to perform mathematical calculations on a given number.

### Functionality
- Accepts a number as input from the user.
- Uses the `math` module to calculate:
  - Square root of the number
  - Natural logarithm (log base e)
  - Sine of the number (in radians)
- Displays all calculated results.

### Sample Output
Enter a number: 25
Square root :5.0
Logarithm :3.2188758248682006
Sine root :-0.13235175009777303

### Concepts Used
- Importing modules
- Built-in math functions (`sqrt`, `log`, `sin`)
- User input and output
